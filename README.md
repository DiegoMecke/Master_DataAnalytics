# Personal repository

### By: Diego Coello de Portugal Mecke

This repository is a collection of some of my past projects in Machine Learning (pulished versions from projects in the Data Anlytics master in Hildesheim university).

All the code is in python, with the majority using Pytorch or Tensorflow. There are less Pytorch projects but they are more complex (including a 1 year research with some of my colleges and my master thesis on Active Learning),
while the Tensorflow projects are shorter but are more and tackle a wider range of subtopics of the Machine Learning field.

Most of the projects will be done in python notebooks to facilitate the explanation of the project setting, the code developed and the explanation of the conclusions.

Lastly, you can find a short overview of the projects:

## Pytorch:
 - **Active Learning Project** : Reimplementation of an Active Learning paper.
    
 - **Adversarial Attacks project** : 1 year project with some of my fellow master students about Adversarial Attacks across Representation Spaces.

## Tensorflow:
 - **Image Segmentation with U-Net**: Image segmentation of pets using a U-Net architecture based model.
 - **Model Performance Analysis** : Analysis of the preformance a simple classification model on CIFAR10.
 - **Time Series classification and RNNs** : Classification of multivariate time series of human movements using LSTM and GRU.
 - **Training Pipeline**: Simple introductory notebook on how to develop basic functionalities for Neural Networks instead of using the default ones.
 - **Variational Autoencoders and Image generation**: Experiments on autoencoders, variational autoencoders (VAE) and how to generate images from VAEs latent space.
